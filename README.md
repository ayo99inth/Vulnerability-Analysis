# Vulnerability-Analysis
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to vulnerability analysis tools used for discovering security flaws, misconfigurations, and weaknesses in networks, applications, and systems.



**In the screenshots these were the observations from the conducted Lab work and exercises**

Lab Observations/Information Gathered: In this lab, the objective was to perform vulnerability analysis on the target system to identify network vulnerabilities, open ports, application configuration errors, operating system details, installed applications, accounts with weak passwords, files and folders with weak permissions, default services and applications, and security configuration mistakes.
Lab Tasks Completed:
1. Performed vulnerability research using vulnerability scoring systems and databases, including Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), and National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
2. Conducted vulnerability assessment using various vulnerability assessment tools, including OpenVAS, Nessus, and CGI Scanner Nikto.
Key Findings:
1. Network Vulnerabilities:
-	Identified multiple vulnerabilities related to open ports and services running on the target system.
-	Discovered potential misconfigurations in network protocols and services.
2. Operating System Details:
-	Determined the operating system version running on the target system, providing insight into potential OS-specific vulnerabilities.


3. Application Configuration Errors:
-	Detected configuration errors in certain applications, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
4. Installed Applications:
-	Identified installed applications and services, which may have associated vulnerabilities if not properly patched or configured.
5. Default Services and Applications:
-	Noted default services and applications that should be reviewed for potential security risks or unnecessary exposure.
6. Security Configuration Mistakes:
-	Identified security configuration mistakes in common applications, indicating the need for security hardening measures.
Personal Analysis for this Lab Activity:
-	The vulnerability assessment revealed multiple areas of concern, emphasizing the importance of regular security audits and proactive vulnerability management.
-	Patching and updating systems, configuring services securely, enforcing strong password policies, and implementing proper access controls are essential to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.
-	Continuous monitoring and periodic vulnerability assessments should be conducted to ensure the security posture of the network remains robust against evolving threats.
-	It's crucial to prioritize remediation efforts based on the severity and impact of identified vulnerabilities.
-	Regularly updating vulnerability databases and scanning tools is necessary to stay current with emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
-	Collaboration with stakeholders, including system administrators and security teams, is essential for effective vulnerability management and risk mitigation.
