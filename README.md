# Vulnerability-Analysis
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to vulnerability analysis tools used for discovering security flaws, misconfigurations, and weaknesses in networks, applications, and systems.

Here is a Breakdown of all the tools used and a Report for the findings during a Vulnerability Assessment.
---

### 1. **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**
   **Description**: CVE is a publicly available database that provides identifiers for known vulnerabilities and exposures in software and hardware. Each CVE identifier gives standardized information about a specific vulnerability, allowing for easier sharing and understanding of security flaws across different tools and platforms.

   **Usage**:
   - **Search for vulnerabilities**: CVE can be used to search for specific vulnerabilities affecting a system or software.
   - For example, visiting the **[CVE website](https://cve.mitre.org/)** allows you to input a software name or CVE ID to look up vulnerability details, exploitability scores, and potential patches.

   **Educational Tip**: Understanding and using CVE identifiers allows security professionals to track vulnerabilities across different tools and platforms efficiently. CVEs provide the foundation for vulnerability analysis by standardizing information about security flaws, which can be further analyzed or mitigated using scanning tools.

### 2. **Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (OpenVAS)**
   **Description**: Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM), formerly known as OpenVAS, is a powerful open-source framework for comprehensive vulnerability scanning and management. It performs network vulnerability tests (NVTs) to identify and assess vulnerabilities in systems and networks.

   **Usage Example**:
   - **Network Scanning**: Launch a scan using Greenbone to identify open ports, services, and known vulnerabilities in the scanned systems.
   - **Configuration**: The tool provides extensive reporting options, helping you prioritize and mitigate vulnerabilities based on severity.

   **Educational Tip**: Greenbone provides an all-in-one solution for vulnerability management, offering a deep analysis of security weaknesses. It's ideal for enterprise-level network scans and reports, helping users identify, manage, and remediate vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Nessus**
   **Description**: Nessus, developed by Tenable, is one of the most popular commercial vulnerability scanners available. It helps identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, default passwords, and other security issues in various systems and applications.

   **Usage Example**:
   - **Performing a scan**: After setting up Nessus, users can select from a variety of scan templates (e.g., Web Application Scanning, Host Discovery, etc.) and run the scan on a target network or system.
   - **Report generation**: Nessus generates detailed reports highlighting critical, high, medium, and low-severity vulnerabilities, helping to prioritize remediation.

   **Educational Tip**: Nessus is often favored in both small businesses and large enterprises for its ease of use and comprehensive vulnerability scanning capabilities. Understanding how to read Nessus reports and using its features to track vulnerabilities over time is critical for long-term vulnerability management.

### 4. **Nikto**
   **Description**: Nikto is an open-source web server vulnerability scanner that identifies potential issues such as outdated software versions, configuration problems, and known vulnerabilities in web servers and web applications.

   **Usage Example**:
   ```bash
   nikto -h http://example.com
   ```
   - **Explanation**: This command scans the web server hosted on `example.com` for common vulnerabilities, including misconfigurations, outdated software, and potentially dangerous files.

   **Educational Tip**: Nikto is particularly useful for assessing the security of web applications and servers. It is a non-invasive tool, meaning it won't exploit vulnerabilities but can help identify key weaknesses that attackers might leverage, making it essential for web server audits.

### 5. **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Vulnerability Framework**
   **Description**: NIST provides a comprehensive set of guidelines, standards, and frameworks related to cybersecurity, including the NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD). NVD is a repository of information related to security vulnerabilities based on CVE data, enriched with additional details such as impact scores and remediation measures.

   **Usage**:
   - **Vulnerability Lookup**: Visit the **[NIST NVD website](https://nvd.nist.gov/)** and search for vulnerabilities by software, severity, or CVE ID.
   - **Use in Compliance**: NIST also provides guidelines such as NIST SP 800-53, which helps organizations structure their vulnerability management programs.

   **Educational Tip**: The NIST vulnerability framework is essential for aligning vulnerability analysis and management with industry standards. Understanding NIST guidelines helps organizations implement best practices in cybersecurity and stay compliant with regulatory requirements.

**In the screenshots these were the observations from the conducted Lab work and exercises**

Lab Observations/Information Gathered: In this lab, the objective was to perform vulnerability analysis on the target system to identify network vulnerabilities, open ports, application configuration errors, operating system details, installed applications, accounts with weak passwords, files and folders with weak permissions, default services and applications, and security configuration mistakes.
Lab Tasks Completed:
1. Performed vulnerability research using vulnerability scoring systems and databases, including Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), and National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
2. Conducted vulnerability assessment using various vulnerability assessment tools, including OpenVAS, Nessus, and CGI Scanner Nikto.
Key Findings:
1. Network Vulnerabilities:
-	Identified multiple vulnerabilities related to open ports and services running on the target system.
-	Discovered potential misconfigurations in network protocols and services.
2. Operating System Details:
-	Determined the operating system version running on the target system, providing insight into potential OS-specific vulnerabilities.


3. Application Configuration Errors:
-	Detected configuration errors in certain applications, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.
4. Installed Applications:
-	Identified installed applications and services, which may have associated vulnerabilities if not properly patched or configured.
5. Default Services and Applications:
-	Noted default services and applications that should be reviewed for potential security risks or unnecessary exposure.
6. Security Configuration Mistakes:
-	Identified security configuration mistakes in common applications, indicating the need for security hardening measures.
Personal Analysis for this Lab Activity:
-	The vulnerability assessment revealed multiple areas of concern, emphasizing the importance of regular security audits and proactive vulnerability management.
-	Patching and updating systems, configuring services securely, enforcing strong password policies, and implementing proper access controls are essential to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.
-	Continuous monitoring and periodic vulnerability assessments should be conducted to ensure the security posture of the network remains robust against evolving threats.
-	It's crucial to prioritize remediation efforts based on the severity and impact of identified vulnerabilities.
-	Regularly updating vulnerability databases and scanning tools is necessary to stay current with emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
-	Collaboration with stakeholders, including system administrators and security teams, is essential for effective vulnerability management and risk mitigation.
